# PLX5622_mice
E3 and E4, male and female mice (12-month-old) fed a control diet or a PLX5622 diet

- 16 scRNAseq samples of meningeal endothelial cells were sent for sequencing.
- Sequenced ~5000 cells at 50k read pairs per cell.
- In this experiment we treated E3 and E4, male and female mice (12-month-old), with a control diet or a PLX5622 diet
  - PLX5622 ablates MHC-II high myeloid cells in the meninges
- Specifically, want to view the effects on the transcriptome on BECs and LECs
- This will then be correlated with the effects on the morphology of the meningeal lymphatics and with our very interesting behavior data
- There are 8 groups and 2 biological replicates per groups (each replicate consisting of cells pooled from two animals)
