# E3/E4 Mice Pilot
- Cell suspensions of meningeal dura enriched by MACS for cells expressing Cd45, Cd31, and Lyve-1
  - Cd45/Ptprc/B220/Ly-5/Lyt-4/T200: transmembrane protein tyrosine phosphatase, 
located on most haematopoietic cells, positive selection of leukocytes
  - Cd31/Pecam1: adhesion and signaling receptor that is expressed on endothelial and hematopoietic cells, positive selection of endothelial cells
  - Lyve1/1200012G08Rik/Lyve-1/Xlkd1/lymphatic vessel endothelial HA receptor-1: found primarily on lymphatic endothelial cells
  - The meningeal layer of the dura mater is a durable, dense fibrous membrane that passes through the foramen magnum and is continuous with the dura mater of the spinal cord. The meningeal layer of the dura mater creates several dural folds that divide the cranial cavity into freely communicating spaces.
  - Aimed for ~5000 cells per sample to be sequenced at least 50,000 reads per cell
    - Might ended up with more because we sequenced with the NovaSeq S2
- Expecting to see a lot of leukocytes and vascular cells
- The purpose is to check the effect of sex, Apoe isoform expression and age (and respective interactions) on the transcriptomes of the different cell subpopulations
