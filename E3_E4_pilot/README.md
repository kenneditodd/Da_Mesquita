# E3/E4 Mice Pilot
- Cell suspensions of meningeal dura enriched by MACS for cells expressing Cd45, Cd31, and Lyve-1
  - Cd45/Ptprc: transmembrane protein tyrosine phosphatase, located on most haematopoietic cells, positive selection of leukocytes
  - Cd31/Pecam1: adhesion and signaling receptor, expressed on endothelial and hematopoietic cells
  - Lyve1: lymphatic vessel endothelial HA receptor-1, found primarily on lymphatic endothelial cells
- Aimed for ~5000 cells per sample to be sequenced at least 50,000 reads per cell
    - Might ended up with more because we sequenced with the NovaSeq S2
- Expecting to see a lot of leukocytes and vascular cells
- The purpose is to check the effect of sex and Apoe isoform expression on the transcriptomes of different cell populations
- Each sample was pooled from two mice?
- 4 samples
  + E3_2M_F = APOE3 expressing; 2 months old; female
  + E3_2M_M = APOE3 expressing; 2 months old; male
  + E4_2M_F = APOE4 expressing; 2 months old; female
  + E4_2M_M = APOE4 expressing; 2 months old; male
