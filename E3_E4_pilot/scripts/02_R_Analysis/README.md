# R Analysis Scripts
- **01_processing.Rmd**
  - This will read counts data, perform prefiltering QC, quality filtering, postfiltering QC, and clustering. 
  - By the end of this script you will have a seurat object with unannotated clusters.
- **02_annotation.Rmd**
  - Read in the unannotated seurat object from 01_preprocessing.Rmd and do in depth dive into cluster annotation.
- **03_QC_and_DE.Rmd**
  - Quality control and differential expression of the annotated seurat object
- **04_QC_and_DE_downsampled.Rmd**
  - All samples downsampled to 3000 cells
  - Quality control and differential expression of the annotated seurat object
- **05_recluster_endothelial.Rmd**
  - Recluster the endothelial population to identify subpopulations
