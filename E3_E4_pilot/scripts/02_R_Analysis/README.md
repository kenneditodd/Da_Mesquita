# R Analysis Scripts
- **01_processing.Rmd**
  - This will read counts data, perform prefiltering QC, quality filtering, postfiltering QC, and clustering. 
  - By the end of this script you will have a seurat object with unannotated clusters.
- **02_pass1_annotation.Rmd**
  - Read in the unannotated seurat object from 01_preprocessing.Rmd and do in depth dive into cluster annotation.
- **03_pass1_quality_reclustering.Rmd**
  - In 02_pass1_annotation.Rmd there were a couple clusters that were difficult to annotate and could potentialy artifact clusters.
  - This script reclusters groups of cells to 'untangle' clusters and identify true cells.
  - The cell barcodes of the artifact clusters were saved to aid in subsetting in the next script.
- **04_pass2_recluster_and_annotation.Rmd** 
  - Artifcact cells are removed and remaining cells are reclustered and annotated.
  - This creates a second, final, cleaned pass of the data with all cell types.
- **05_pass2_QC_and_DE.Rmd**
  - Peforms QC and differential expression on the annotated seurat object.
- **06_pass2_subcluster.Rmd**
  - Recluster specific cell types to identify subpopulations.
- **07_pass2_endothelial_QC_and_DE.Rmd**
  - Perform QC and differential expression on the reclustered endothelial cells created in 06_pass2_subcluster.Rmd. 
- **08_pass2_macrophages_monocytes_QC_and_DE.Rmd**
  - Perform QC and differential expression on the reclustered macrophages & monocytes created in 06_pass2_subcluster.Rmd.
